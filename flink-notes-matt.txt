This is how I'm running on Flink
Go to the place where you installed flink, say $HOME/flink-1.8.0/
Place the script below --- there.
NOTES:
- Files like metastore.json, the .ktr or the fat jar can be also stored in hdfs://
- File name resolution is done using HDFS. Make sure to configure your local environment for HDFS in that case, set HADOOP_CONF_DIR for example
- Put the fat jar (for now generated with Spoon) in $HOME/software/
- Put your MetaStore export (for now exported with Spoon) in $HOME/metadata

Pass one argument to the script: The transformation file (.ktr)
